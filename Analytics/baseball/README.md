Data analytics project from a PostgreSQL course I did. (project not yet finished)

The goal was to do advanced queries from a big baseball database to create awards and more (wich I had a big time doing, querying is a skill I'm working on to improve).

Then, I had the idea to try and import the database to powerBI, and create some dashboards.
As a begginer to creating dashboards and fetching data into PowerBI, I'm still working on this project.
