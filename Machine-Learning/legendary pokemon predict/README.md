This was my first contact with Machine Learning in Python, using Jupyter Notebook, where the goal was to predict if a pokémon was legendary or not, based on given pokémon dataset (pokedex).

You can check the code and plots in the markdown file: [pokemon.md](https://github.com/ianbrussolo/Data-science/blob/37db811babeefd98c9fb2448eed372212ee8ba8e/Machine-Learning/legendary%20pokemon%20predict/pokemon.md)

This was a tutorial follow along project.
