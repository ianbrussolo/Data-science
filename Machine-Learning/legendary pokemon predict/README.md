This was my first contact with Machine Learning in Python, using Jupyter Notebook, where the goal was to predict if a pokémon was legendary or not, based on given pokémon dataset (pokedex).

You can check the code and plots in the markdown file: ![pokemon.md](https://github.com/ianbrussolo/Data-science/blob/9f766ace94f70f358f55685cffbb872e1f121e5f/Machine-Learning/legendary%20pokemon%20predict/pokemon.md)

This was a tutorial follow along project.
